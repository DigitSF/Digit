Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees and submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of Digit.
